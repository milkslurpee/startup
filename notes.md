I learned how to clone a github repository, pull from github to VsCode, push from VsCode back to github, and resolve merge conflicts.

DOM's or Data Object Models are programming interfaces for web documents. THey represent the structure of an HTML od XML document with a tree like structure, where each node represents a part of the document (elements, attributes, text). It provides a way from programs like JavaScript to interact with the structure, content, and style of web documents.

In JavaScript "#" usually is used to identify elements in an HTML file. For example

        <label for="code">Code:</label>
        <input type="text" id="code" placeholder="input code here" />
        <button type="button" onclick="redeem()">Redeem</button>

    this is the HTML for the input box "code"

          const code = document.querySelector("#code").value;
        
    this is the JavaScript line which takes whatever string is submitted in the box and sets it as a new variable which can be used.

They can also just be comments, or can be used to denot hexidecimal values for colors.

Difference between the #title and .grid selectors:
#title is an ID selector, so it should be fairly specific. There really shouldnt be multiple elements with the same ID. However .grid is a class selector, which is normally applied to multiple elements in a page. Also, ID selectors take precendence over class selectors, so if you have an ID selector that changes an element that is also part of a class, the ID selector changes will override class selector changes.

The <link> element in HTML is used to define relationships between the current document and an external resource. They are used for: 
    CSS stylesheets
    Favicons
    Alternate stylesheets
    Prefetching and Preloading
    DNS prefetching
    External Scripts

The <div> tag is really versatile element used for creating divisions or sections in a web page. It can be used for:
    Creating sections or containers
    Styling and layout
    Grouping other elements
    Responsive elements

A web certificate (SSL/TLS certificate) is required to enable HTTPS on a website, ensuring secure communication by encrypting data between the server and the client.

A DNS A record maps a domain name to an IP address, and it can point directly to an IP address or to another A record, which ultimately resolves to an IP address.

JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write. It's based on JavaScript object syntax but is a text format independent of programming languages.

Use the <script> tag to add JavaScript to an HTML file

New properties can be added to JavaScript objects even after the object is created using dot notation or square brackets.

<!DOCTYPE html> us used to declare a document as an HTML file

HTML tags:
Paragraph: <p></p>
Ordered list: <ol></ol>
Unordered list: <ul></ul>
Second-level heading: <h2></h2>
First-level heading: <h1></h1>
Third-level heading: <h3></h3>

 To display an image with a hyperlink, use the <a> (anchor) tag to create a link and place the <img> tag inside it: <a href="URL"><img src="image.jpg" alt="Description"></a>.

 The CSS rule to change the background color of all <div> elements to red is: div { background-color: red; }.

 The map() method creates a new array by transforming each element in an existing array using a provided function. It's used for iterating through an array and creating a new array based on the function's logic.
